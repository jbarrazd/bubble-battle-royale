### Core Gameplay Loop
**Primary Loop (120-180 seconds):**
1. **Analyze bubble pattern blocking objective** (5s initial planning)
2. **Shoot bubbles to create matches and clear path** (60-120s main gameplay)
3. **Identify and break power-up bubbles** (opportunistic, throughout match)
4. **Collect and strategically use power-ups** (tactical decisions)
5. **Line up precision shot when path is clear** (critical moment)
6. **Hit objective with bubble for victory** (1-2s execution)
7. **Victory/Defeat feedback** (5s celebration/analysis)

### Win/Loss Conditions
**Victory Conditions:**
- Successfully hit the central objective with a bubble
- Opponent runs out of moves before hitting objective
- Opponent's bubbles cross danger line (forfeit)

**Failure States:**
- Opponent hits the objective first
- Your bubbles cross the danger line
- Run out of moves with objective still blocked
- Time limit expires (closest to objective wins)

## Game Mechanics

### Primary Mechanics

#### **Objective Targeting System**
**Description:** Players must hit the central objective (treasure chest/space core/magic crystal) directly with a bubble to win. The objective is protected by layers of bubbles that must be cleared first. The objective changes visual appearance based on arena theme but maintains same hitbox size.

**Player Input:** Aim and shoot bubbles to clear path, then precision shot to hit objective

**System Response:** Objective has visual "shield" indicator showing it's blocked, glows when a clear shot is available, victory trigger on direct hit, celebration animation specific to theme

**Implementation Notes:**
- Objective hitbox: 1.5x bubble size for fairness
- Visual indicator when line-of-sight is clear
- Network sync on objective hit only (not near-misses)
- Different objective animations per theme (chest opens, core activates, crystal shatters)

**Dependencies:** Bubble Shooting system

#### **Bubble Shooting & Matching**
**Description:** Players aim and shoot colored bubbles to create matches of 3+ same-colored bubbles. Matches clear bubbles and any disconnected bubbles fall, creating chain reactions. Trajectory preview line shows exact path including wall bounces.

**Player Input:** Touch/drag to aim, release to shoot (mobile); Mouse aim + click (desktop); Analog stick + button (gamepad)

**System Response:** Bubble travels at 800 pixels/second, physics-based collision detection, immediate pop animation on match, gravity fall for disconnected bubbles with 0.5s delay

**Implementation Notes:**
- Arcade Physics for bubble movement and collision
- Color-blind friendly patterns on bubbles
- Object pooling for bubble instances (expect 100+ on screen)
- Particle effects on match (pooled, max 10 simultaneous)

**Dependencies:** None (core system)

#### **Power-Up Bubble System**
**Description:** Special bubbles with unique visual markers (glowing outline, rotating animation, star pattern) appear randomly in the field. These are clearly distinguished from normal bubbles. Breaking them drops a random power-up that must be collected before it expires.

**Player Input:** Shoot the special power-up bubble to break it, automatic collection when power-up drops

**System Response:** Power-up bubble has distinct visual (pulsing glow, special icon overlay), breaks in 1 hit releasing power-up drop, 3-second collection window with floating animation, power-up stored in inventory

**Power-Up Types (Self-Improvement):**
- **Speed Boost** (Common - 20%): Next 3 bubbles travel at 2x speed
- **Bomb** (Common - 15%): Next bubble explodes clearing 7-bubble radius
- **Rainbow** (Rare - 10%): Next bubble matches any color
- **Laser Sight** (Rare - 8%): Extended aim line showing full trajectory for 5 shots
- **Multi-shot** (Legendary - 3%): Shoot 3 bubbles in spread pattern
- **Shield** (Rare - 8%): Blocks next opponent sabotage power-up

**Power-Up Types (Opponent Sabotage):**
- **Bubble Slowdown** (Common - 15%): Opponent's next 3 bubbles travel at 0.5x speed
- **Aim Wobble** (Common - 10%): Opponent's aim line shakes for 5 seconds
- **Color Blind** (Rare - 5%): Opponent's bubbles turn grayscale for 8 seconds
- **Reverse Controls** (Rare - 3%): Opponent's aim controls inverted for 5 seconds
- **Fog of War** (Legendary - 2%): Opponent's top half of screen fogs for 5 seconds
- **Bubble Swap** (Legendary - 1%): Randomly shuffles opponent's next 3 bubble colors

**Implementation Notes:**
- Power-up bubbles spawn every 20-30 seconds
- Visual distinction: 2x glow effect + spinning icon inside bubble
- Audio cue when power-up bubble spawns
- Different rarity levels have different visual effects (common=blue glow, rare=purple, legendary=gold)

**Dependencies:** Bubble Shooting system, Inventory UI

#### **Combo Power-Up System**
**Description:** Creating large bubble matches (combo of 3+ groups) or chain reactions rewards players with instant random power-ups. The bigger the combo, the better the power-up rarity. This rewards skilled shooting and planning ahead.

**Player Input:** Create matches that cause chain reactions or clear large groups

**System Response:** Combo counter displays on screen (x2, x3, x4...), screen shake intensifies with combo size, power-up automatically granted at combo thresholds, special effects and sounds escalate with combo magnitude

**Combo Thresholds:**
- **3-Group Combo:** Grants random common power-up (70% chance) or nothing (30%)
- **4-Group Combo:** Grants random common power-up guaranteed
- **5-Group Combo:** Grants random rare power-up (80% chance) or common (20%)
- **6+ Group Combo:** Grants random rare (60%) or legendary power-up (40%)
- **Power-Up Type Selection:** 60% chance self-improvement, 40% chance opponent sabotage

**Visual Feedback:**
- Combo counter with escalating colors (white→blue→purple→gold)
- Particle explosions that increase with combo size
- Screen effects: slight shake at 3x, moderate at 5x, intense at 6x+
- "COMBO!" text that scales with multiplier

**Implementation Notes:**
- Combo window: 1.5 seconds between pops to maintain combo
- Maximum combo multiplier: x10 (for display purposes)
- Power-ups from combos don't use inventory slots (instant activation)
- Network sync: Only final combo result needs syncing
- AI considers combo potential in higher difficulties

**Dependencies:** Bubble Shooting system, Particle System, UI Feedback System

#### **Competitive Arena Racing (REVISED)**
**Description:** Both players compete to be first to hit the central objective with a bubble. The objective starts blocked by identical bubble patterns. Players can see opponent's progress via ghost overlay. Self-improvement power-ups affect your board, while sabotage power-ups disrupt your opponent's gameplay.

**Player Input:** Strategic bubble shooting to clear path, collect power-ups, precision shot at objective

**System Response:** Real-time opponent progress visibility, "Path Clear!" notification when objective is exposed, victory animation on successful hit, defeat animation if opponent hits first

**Implementation Notes:**
- Identical starting patterns for fairness
- AI calculates optimal path but adds inefficiency based on difficulty
- Network prediction for opponent's shots to hide latency
- Objective must be fully visible (no partial shots through gaps)

**Dependencies:** Objective Targeting, Power-Up System, Network/AI Systems

#### **Team Coordination (2v2 Modes)**
**Description:** Two players work together sharing the same playfield. Alternate turns every 5 seconds or after shot. Shared power-up inventory accessible by both players. Team-specific combo bonuses for coordinated clears.

**Player Input:** Shot during your turn window; Quick-chat commands (preset messages); Power-up requests/sharing

**System Response:** Turn indicator and countdown timer, combo multiplier for back-to-back team clears, shared progress tracking, team victory/loss conditions

**Implementation Notes:**
- Turn queue system with 5-second windows
- Spectator view during teammate's turn
- AI teammates use cooperative strategy patterns
- Network optimization: only active player sends input

**Dependencies:** Bubble Shooting, Power-Up System, Network/AI Systems
